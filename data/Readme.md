In this data, in the first round Player A chose Betrayal and Player B chose Betrayal, and both of them learned the outcome after the first round of play, so in the second round, out of anger at the other's betrayal, both chose Betrayal again, and thus ended up with the lowest payoffs. In fact, if both of them had chosen to cooperate, it would have triggered the game's reward mechanism, and I would have given each of them 400 points for the purpose of rewarding them for correcting their behavior; however, neither of them was rational enough to do so in this experiment, and thus the game ended up failing, resulting in the lowest payoff. This is also a challenge to the rational economic man hypothesis, if both men are rational economic men, they should choose to change their strategy rather than persist in their betrayal when the payoff for this strategy is lowest. However, whether the two men would have changed their strategy if they did not know the final number of payoffs remains a question worth exploring.
